    This class is the interface where the evaluation scripts communicate with your trained agent.

    You can initialize your model and load weights in the __init__ function. At each environment interactions,
    the batched observation `obs`, a numpy array with shape (Batch Size, Obs Dim), will be passed into the __call__
    function. You need to generate the action, a numpy array with shape (Batch Size, Act Dim=2), and return it.

    Do not change the name of this class.
